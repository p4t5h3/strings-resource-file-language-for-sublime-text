# Strings Resource File Syntax Definition for Sublime Text

Syntax highlighting support of [strings resource files](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/Strings/Strings.html) for Sublime Text.
That file format is typically used for translations on the Apple platforms.
This package can be handy, if you use Sublime Text as your Xcode sidekick to swiftly plow through projects.

Created out of a personal need and to refresh my experience in creating Sublime Text Packages.

## Package Control

This package was previously listed on Package Control as "Xcode Strings".
I realized the artificial restriction to Xcode is misleading as it is not exclusively tied to it.
The strings resource file format is used across the whole platform and independently from Xcode.
Hence the package rename.
